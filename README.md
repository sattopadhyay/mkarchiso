# mkarchiso
Build my Custom Arch Linux ISO from an existing installation of Arch Linux with archiso, a modified baseline config.

## Points to note:
1. This ISO does not support BIOS systems.
2. This ISO uses networkmanager instead of systemd-networkd
3. This ISO comes with nano,neovim and git.
4. There is no accessibility support for the blind.
5. There is no support for virtualbox, temporary support for qemu is present.
